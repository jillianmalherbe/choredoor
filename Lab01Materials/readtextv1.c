// READTESTV1.C - Lab01 - David Athersych
//
// Program to read text file and write contents to stdout.
// This version has name of file hardcoded. (See around line 10 of main() for
// file open call.)
//
// WARNING: Depending on which programming tools (IDE) you use, you may have
// to modify the name of the text file you want to read.
// In some environments, if you put the text file and the program source
// file in the same folder (directory), then the compiler creates the
// executable in the same folder. When you run the program, it treats that
// folder as your "current working directory" and assumes that any
// references to files without a full path name are to files in the
// current working directory. So the fopen() looks like:
// 			fp = fopen("textfile.txt", "r");
// In other environments, your executable is stored in a sub-directory
// (such as Debug) of the directory where the source file is. So, when
// you run the program, its current working directory is not the one where
// the text file is - it is one below. In those environments, the fopen()
// has to look like:
// 			fp = fopen("../textfile.txt", "r");
// which means look for the file in the directory above the current one.
